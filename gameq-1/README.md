Information
===========
Copy of GameQ for Git. Done to allow submoduling of GameQ into other projects as I am sure you want. I make no claim to this product I am just hosting it on GitHub.

I will try to keep this repo updated as new games come out.  Feel free to leave messages with needed updates as well at my Gihub page https://github.com/Austinb/GameQ.

See example.php for how to.

For more information see http://gameq.sourceforge.net/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/gameq/
