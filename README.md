# legacy-query-library-archive

This repository contains an archive of old open-source game query library code from around the net.
These are collected here mostly for reference, in case a new query library (like Gamedig) needs to implement one of these older query protocols.

Some of these libraries are still actively maintained, but are cloned here for ease of search.

Contributions to this repository are not accepted. This is an archive for reference only.
